# C Programming Assignments

This repository contains several programming assignments completed in the C language. Each folder includes the source code for an individual task.

## List of Assignments

### Assignment 1: Rectangle Validation from Four Points
- **Description**: This program determines whether four given points form a rectangle on a 2D plane. Each point is represented by its x and y coordinates. It only returns `true` if the points are ordered correctly along the rectangle's perimeter; otherwise, it returns `false`.
- **Highlights**: Input validation is required, and the program outputs an error message for invalid inputs.

### Assignment 2: Alien Message Synchronization Program
- **Description**: A program to analyze messages received from an alien civilization and compute when those messages synchronize. Messages are given as lowercase strings, with each character representing a pulse of a different length.
- **Highlights**: The program calculates synchronization times, and if synchronization is not possible, it outputs a specific message. Input validation is also included.

### Assignment 3: Weekday Calculation Functions
- **Description**: Implements a function to determine whether a given date falls on a weekday and another function to count the number of weekdays in a given date range.
- **Highlights**: Verifies the validity of year, month, and day inputs. Outputs specific error messages for invalid dates.

### Assignment 4: Castle Dominance Area Calculation
- **Description**: Implements a function to calculate the area controlled by a castle on a map divided into an n×n grid of tiles, each with a known elevation. A castle can dominate the largest rectangular area in which it is the highest point.
- **Highlights**: For each tile containing a castle, calculates the area of the largest rectangle it can dominate. Results are stored in a 2D array.

### Assignment 5: E-shop Review Statistics Analyzer
- **Description**: Analyzes statistical review data collected from an e-shop and finds the interval of reviews that has a total rating closest to a given target.
- **Highlights**: Identifies the closest rating interval and outputs its start and end dates. Invalid review formats trigger an error message.

### Assignment 8: Sparse Matrix Functions
- **Description**: Implements a set of functions to work with sparse matrices—matrices in which most values are unset (i.e., treated as zeros).
- **Highlights**: Efficiently represents the matrix using a singly linked list. Rows and columns are stored in ascending order.
